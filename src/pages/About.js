      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>I grew up in South Central California. I did some time in the Army, where I was based in Washington State, and deployed to Afghanistan. After the Army, I went to Northwest Culinary Institute in Vancouver, Washington. I enjoyed my time in the culinary industry, but programming has always been a true passion of mine ever since I created my first html page with my Windows 98 as a kid. After rekindling this passion for technology, I made some games, learned many programming languages, and honed my skills by making websites with HTML, CSS, and Javascript before being accepted to Per Scholas- a Google affiliated technology bootcamp where I earned a certificate in Software Engineering. When most people see a keyboard and mouse, they think about what they can say on social media, or what they can search. When I see a keyboard, I see that I can build anything I could possibly dream with some good planning, consistency, and determination.</h3>
